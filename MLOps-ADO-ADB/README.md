# MLOps with Azure DevOps and Azure Databricks
MLOps-ado-adb is a repo created by Microsoft field personnel (GBB, CSA, MTC) that provides a template to facilitate an introductory workshop on modern MLOps practices, using Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines and Azure Databricks for ML asset development and compute. This repo is modeled after the [work](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOpsTemplate/) of Microsoft's West Region CSU, which instead uses GitHub Actions and Azure Machine Learning.

Here is the link to the workshop materials:

## 1. Create resources in Azure
>Note: To create resources you need an `Owner` or `Contributor` role for your subscription or resource group. If you don't have either one of these roles, you cannot create any of the following resources.

- 1.1 Open the following link in a new tab.

    [![Deploy to Azure](./images/deploy-to-azure.svg)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FMLOpsTemplate%2Fmain%2Fsrc%2Fworkshop%2Fdocuments%2FIaC%2Fiac_EZ_MLOps.json)

- 1.2 Fill out the rest and click the `Create` button at the bottom.

    ![](./images/arm000.png)

    > Note: The provisioning will take 4 mins to 5 mins. If you want to see the progress of the provisioning, you can click the 'Notification' icon. When the provisioning is done, leave the tab open (don't close it!). You can leave it and open a new tab in your browser for the next step.
    ![](./images/arm001.png)

    > IMPORTANT: If this deployment fails, you cannot do the following steps in the workshop. Please inform your CSA or lab instructor with the error message.

## 2. Setup Github Account and Settings

- 2.1 From the new browser tab, go to [Github](https://github.com/) and login to your account.
    > Note: If you don't have an account for Github, please sign up. The workshop can't be done without a Github account.

- 2.2 After the login, go to [https://github.com/microsoft/MLOpsTemplate](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOpsTemplate) and click `Fork`.
    ![](./images/run_mlopsworkshop_azcli009.png)

    > Note: You will have the same repository (`MLOpsTemplate`) under your Github account name.
    > Leave the tab open and **do not** close it yet. You will come back to your repository.

## 3. Choose your development environment
In this step you will clone the above forked repository into a development environment. You can choose between either using the Compute Instance in Azure Machine Learning (this was pre-created as part of the above steps) or your local laptop. Based on this choice, follow the related instructions:
    - [Option A. Use CI in AML](#Option-A-Use-Compute-Instance-in-AML)
    - [Option B. Use Your laptop(PC/MAC)](#Option-B-Use-your-laptop-(PC/MAC))

### Option A. Use Compute Instance in AML

- A1. Go to [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://ml.azure.com)

- A2. Go to __Compute__ > __Compute Instance__

- A3. Click new __Terminal link__

    - Make sure you have forked the repo to your repository
    - Before you run following command, update _{YOURGITHUBACCOUNT}_ part
    - Run the following command to clone:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/{YOURGITHUBACCOUNT}/MLOpsTemplate.git
     ```

> Note: Make sure you are running the command from a similar path structure like below:
> `~/cloudfiles/code/Users/YOURALIAS$`

![](./images/run_mlopsworkshop_azcli004.png)

- A5. Generate and register data for the workshop

    - Update arguments "_NAMES_ and _ID_" accordingly and then run following commands from the Terminal

        ```bash
        cd ./MLOpsTemplate/src/workshop
        conda env create -f conda-local.yml
        conda activate mlops-workshop-local
        python ./data/create_datasets.py --datastore_name workspaceblobstore --ml_workspace_name "AML_WS_NAME" --sub_id "SUBSCRIPTION_ID" --resourcegroup_name "RG_NAME"
        ```
        
> Note: You can find the __Resource Group Name, Azure Machine Learning Name__ and the __Location__ from Azure portal.

## 4. Configure secret in your Github account

The last two tasks include:
   - Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT) in Github
   - Adding a Service Principal (SP) to your forked repository in Github


### 4.1 Create PAT (Personal Access Token)

You are going to create PAT to allow your code access your personal git repo

- To make PAT, you need to go to Settings of your account, NOT repo setting

    ![](./images/github4003.png)

- From the setting, find and __click__ '_<> Developer settings_' menu at the bottom left conner of your screen

    ![](./images/github4004.png)

- __Click__ '_Personal access token_' and __click__ '_Generate new token_'

    ![](./images/github4005.png)

- Check for '_repo_' and '_workflow_' for the scope and then __click__ '_create_' at the bottom of your screen

    ![](./images/github4006.png)

- You'll see the token. Make sure you copy and keep it safe. 

    ![](./images/github4007.png)

- Now you're going to add the token to your repo

- Go back to your 'MLOpsTemplate' repo where your forked from microsoft/MLOpsTemplate

    - The url of your repo will looks like this

        ```text
        https://github.com/{YOURACCOUNT}}/MLOpsTemplate
        ```

- From your repo __click__ '_Setting_'

    ![](./images/github4000.png)

- Find a menu '_Secrets_' on the left side of menu, and __click__ 'Actions'. After that __Click__ 'New repository secret'

    ![](./images/github4001.png)

- Type `USER_NAME_GITHUB_SECRET` for the name of the secret, and paste the token you copied from PAT section

    > Important: The name for this secret must be `USER_NAME_GITHUB_SECRET`

    ![](./images/github4008.png)




### 4.2 Add SP to your repo in Github

From this section, you'll add the SP information to your repo. The SP information will be used during the Github Actions.

You have saved in step A9, B9 or C7 the output of the SP creation command, it should look like this:

```json
{
	"clientId": "YOUR_APP_ID",
	"clientSecret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
	"subscriptionId": "SUB_ID",
	"tenantId": "TENANT_ID",
	"activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
	"resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
	"activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
	"sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
	"galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
	"managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
```

- Go back to your 'MLOpsTemplate' repo where your forked from microsoft/MLOpsTemplate

    - The url of your repo will looks like this

        ```text
        https://github.com/{YOURACCOUNT}}/MLOpsTemplate
        ```

- From your repo __click__ '_Setting_'

    ![](./images/github4000.png)

- Find a menu '_Secrets_' on the left side of menu, and __click__ 'Actions'. After that __Click__ 'New repository secret'

    ![](./images/github4001.png)

- Type `AZURE_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME` for the name of the secret, and paste your SP json definition:

    > Important: The name for this secret must be `AZURE_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME`
